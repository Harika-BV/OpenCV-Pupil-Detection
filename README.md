**Libraries**
> Numpy
```
Numpy stands for Numerical Python. Using NumPy, Mathematical and logical operations can be performed on the mutlidimensional arrays.
```

> CV
```
CV stands for Computer Vision. OpenCV library is used to make the computer to gain a high-level understanding on the digital images/ videos. The main idea of computer vision is to automate the tasks that human visual systems can do.

**Cascade Classifiers**
> haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
```
A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect particular objects from the source. The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is a haar cascade designed by OpenCV to detect the frontal face.
```

> haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml
```
The haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml is a haar cascade designed by OpenCV to detect the eyes.
